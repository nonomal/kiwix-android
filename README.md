# Kiwix Android

Kiwix is an offline reader for Web content. One of its main purposes
is to make [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) available
offline. This is achieved by reading the content of a file in the
[ZIM](https://openzim.org) format, a highly compressed open format
with additional metadata.

This is the version for Android, with [support versions ranging from 7.1
to 13](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android/blob/main/buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/Config.kt).

**Important Note**: Starting from Android 11, the ZIM file picker
feature has been restricted in the [Play Store
variant](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kiwix.kiwixmobile)
due to Play Store policies. This means that users running Android 11
and above will not be able to load ZIM files from internal/external
storage directly within the app if they have downloaded Kiwix from the
Google Play Store. This restriction is in place to comply with the
Play Store policies. The Play Store variant of Kiwix does not require
the `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission anymore, which is necessary
to scan storage and access ZIM files at arbitrary locations.
Therefore, the storage scanning & file picking functionalities are not
available in this variant anymore. For already downloaded ZIM files, You can copy
them to the `Android/media/org.kiwix.kiwixmobile/` folder, and the application will read them.
Before uninstalling the application, please ensure that you move all your ZIM files
from this folder, as they will be automatically deleted when the application is uninstalled
or if the application data is cleared.  To use the full version of Kiwix
and benefit of the ZIM file picker feature, you can download it
directly from the [official
repository](https://download.kiwix.org/release/kiwix-android/) or use
[IzzyOnDroid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/org.kiwix.kiwixmobile). We understand that this
restriction may cause inconvenience, but it is necessary to comply
with the Play Store policies and ensure a smooth user experience.  We
recommend using the official version of the app available on our
website to access the complete set of features.

Possible paths for play store version which supports for the scanning/reading ZIM files.

## Build instructions

To build Kiwix Android, clone [this
repository](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android) and import (not
open) the project with [Android
Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

If you prefer to build without Android Studio you must first set up
the Android SDK and then run the command: `./gradlew build ` from the
root directory of the project. The project requires `Java 17` to run,
Therefore set the `Gradle JDK` to `Java 17`.

Kiwix Android is a multi-module project, in 99% of scenarios you will
want to build the `app` module in the `debug` configuration. If you
are interested in our custom apps, they have their own repo
[kiwix-android-custom](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android-custom).
